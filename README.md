Article: [First AI Software Engineer Devin Bungling Tasks](https://futurism.com/first-ai-software-engineer-devin-bungling-tasks)

As the article notes, tech companies and especially AI companies as we have seen many times before overpromise and underdeliver. This appears to be the case with Devin as well, the "first AI software engineer". Humans, fortunately, are still outperforming Devin which gets stuck on simple tasks or overcomplicates things for itself. I think additionally place where Devin will take a long, long time to replace a human SWE is writing reusable, compatible code and being able to communicate with teams, stakeholders, and people without technical knowledge to incorporate changing requirements and constraints.
